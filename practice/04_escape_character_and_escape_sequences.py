# ESCAPE CHARACTER AND ESCAPE SEQUENCES
# =====================================

'''
OVERVIEW
--------
The backslash \ is the "escape character". It lets you insert special
characters into a string or use quotes without ending the string.

When combined with a recognized character, it forms an "escape sequence."

    \n  - Newline, like pressing Enter.
    \t  - Tab, like pressing Tab.
    \'  - Single quote, useful in single-quoted strings.
    \"  - Double quote, useful in double-quoted strings.
    \\  - Backslash, since \ is itself the escape character.

# sequences. Notice that it will print out what you literally typed and ignore
# the escape characters.
